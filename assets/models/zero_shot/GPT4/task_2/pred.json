    "pred_answer": "The angular momentum (L) of a body due to Earth's rotation can be calculated using the formula L = I\u03c9, where I is the moment of inertia and \u03c9 is the angular velocity. The moment of inertia (I) of a body is given by the formula I = m*r^2, where m is the mass of the body and r is the radius of the circle described by the body's motion. Assuming an average human mass of 70 kg and considering the radius to be the Earth's radius (approximately 6.371*10^6 m), the moment of inertia would be approximately 1.82*10^14 kg*m^2. Given the Earth's angular velocity (0.000072 rad/sec), the angular momentum would be approximately 1.31*10^10 kg*m^2/s.",
