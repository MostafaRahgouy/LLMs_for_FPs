F2 states that a typical semester runs for 16 weeks.\n4. F3 states that the average number of classes a student takes in a week is 5.\n5. F4 states that the average number of sheets of paper used in a class is 10.\n6. F5 states that the size of a sheet of paper is 8.5 x 11 inches.\n7. Q1 asks for the total number of students at the University of Maryland.\n8. Q2 asks for the total number of class hours in a typical semester.\n9. Q3 asks for the number of weeks in a semester.\n10. Q4 asks for the total number of hours in a week that a student spends in class.\n11. Q5 asks for the number of sheets of paper a student uses in a class.\n12. Q6 asks for the size of a sheet of paper.\n13. A1 provides the answer to Q1, which is 40,000.\n14. A2 provides the answer to Q2, which is 16.\n15. A3 provides the answer to Q3, which is 5.\n16. A4 provides the answer to Q4, which is 10.\n17. A5 provides the answer to Q6, which is \"8.5 x 11 inches\".\n18. We use the provided formulas and answers to calculate the final answer using the program P: Mul(Q1, Mul(Q2, Mul(Q4, Q5))).\n19. The program calculates the total number of sheets of paper used by multiplying the number of students, the number of class hours, the number of hours in a week, and the number of sheets of paper used in a class.\n20. The final answer is the total number of sheets of paper used by all the students at the University of Maryland in one semester.",
