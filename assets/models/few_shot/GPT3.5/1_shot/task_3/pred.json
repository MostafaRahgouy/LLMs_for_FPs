Fact F1 states that the rate of erosion depends on factors such as wave action, wind, and sediment supply. Fact F2 states that it is difficult to determine an exact time frame for this process as it can vary greatly.\n\nNext, the program asks two questions (Q1 and Q2) related to the topic. Question Q1 asks about the factors that affect the rate of erosion, and question Q2 asks if an exact time frame can be determined for the process.\n\nThe program then provides two answers (A1 and A2) to the questions. Answer A1 states the factors that affect the rate of erosion, which are wave action, wind, and sediment supply. Answer A2 states that an exact time frame cannot be determined as it can vary greatly.\n\nFinally, the program combines the questions Q1 and Q2 using the multiplication operator (Mul) to indicate that both questions are relevant to the overall answer.
