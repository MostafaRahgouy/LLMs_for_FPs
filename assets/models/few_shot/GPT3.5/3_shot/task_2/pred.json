Two hollow metal hemispheres with a flat metal rim (flange) were placed together and the air removed from the interior with a primitive vacuum pump. The external pressure of the air pushed them together. When they tried to pull the hemispheres apart using two rings welded to the hemispheres, they could not be pulled apart even by a number of people pulling together. The sphere produced by putting the two hemispheres together is about the size of a basketball. Estimate the force needed to pull them apart.",
